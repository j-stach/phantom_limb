-- The Shins

Crate for simulating sensor inputs and reading behavioral outputs for bionic neural networks. <br>
Use this tool as an example for building signal interfaces with Cajal.

Library for building external interfaces to cajal neural networks.

Simple mock executables for testing AI build

TODO
- Start a service with a list of ports to listen at and to send to
- TBD Specify spectrum names, how to organize?
- Randomly-timed random-data packets to each sensor port
- Read port, value to std out

TODO
- command line interface

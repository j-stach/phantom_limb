# Phantom Limb

*"So we just skirt the hallway sides, a phantom and a fly; Follow the lines and wonder why there's no connection."* -- The Shins

Crate for simulating sensor inputs and reading behavioral outputs for bionic neural networks. <br>
Use this tool as an example for building a signal interface with Cajal.

TODO
- Start a service with a list of ports to listen at and to send to
- TBD Specify spectrum names, how to organize?
- Randomly-timed random-data packets to each sensor port
- Read port, value to std out
